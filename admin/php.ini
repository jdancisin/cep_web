; CMS PHP Config Files
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; These config files attempt to reset PHP and Apache settings to standard values and turn off
; deprecated or problematic features that would otherwise cause errors or problems.
;
; NOTE: These files aren't supported on all servers, but on many they will prevent problems.
; However, they are OPTIONAL and you can safely remove these files if needed.
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; .htaccess - For Apache, Apache PHP module and IIS with .htaccess emulator: http://php.net/configuration.changes
; .user.ini - For servers running PHP in CGI/FastCGI mode: http://php.net/configuration.file.per-user
; php.ini   - For servers that support custom php.ini files: http://php.net/configuration.file
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; *** IMPORTANT!!! If you make any changes to this file save a backup copy as <filename>.backup
; so you have a backup in case your changes get overwritten next time you upgrade.

; EXPERIMENTAL - HOW TO FIX 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR (ON CMS INSTALL)
; If you're getting an "Internal Server Error" when INSTALLING the CMS here's what to do:
; 1) Create a temporary phpinfo.php in your website root with this: <?php phpinfo(); ?>
; 2) Because that file is above your cms folder it will show default server settings that are unaffected by the CMS config files (php.ini, .htaccess, and .user.ini)
; 3) View that phpinfo.php in your browser and search for this setting: cgi.force_redirect (it may or may not be found)
; 4) If cgi.force_redirect is found and is set to 0 in the left-most column, uncomment the line below (by removing the ;)
;cgi.force_redirect = 0
; 5) IF THAT DOESN'T WORK: re-comment the line above and try disabling this config file by renaming it to: php.ini.disabled
; 6) Remove temporary phpinfo.php file in website root
